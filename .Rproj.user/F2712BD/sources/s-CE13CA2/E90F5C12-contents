## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#practice 1: creating an object with a value
```{r}
2 -> a
b <- 3

65 + a
```

#practice 2: to check the value of an object, type the name out(special names repuire-> `name` ) 
```{r}
47->c
c
```

#practice 3: if you want to name an object with special names, use the symble -> `
```{r}
`107 semester grade`<-80

10+`107 semester grade`
```

#practice 4: to check the class of an object< use -> class()
```{r}
a<- 10 # this will override the previous value assigned to a

class(a)

a2<- 10L # L means its an integer

class(a2)
```

#practice 5:
```{r}
avector<- c(1,1,1)
a2vector<- c(1L,1L,1L)

class(avector)
class(a2vector) #type of a value inside th vector

```
